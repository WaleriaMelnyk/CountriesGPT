what command to use in git to download repository from github

ChatGPT
To download a repository from GitHub to your local machine, you need to use the git clone command. Here's how you do it:

First, navigate to the GitHub repository page that you want to clone.

On the repository page, you will find a "Code" button. Click on it and you will see a URL, which is the link to the repository. Copy this URL.

Open a terminal on your local machine.

Navigate to the directory where you want to store the repository.

Type the following command and replace <URL> with the URL you copied from the GitHub repository page:

sh
Copy code
git clone <URL>
For example, if you want to clone the repository at https://github.com/username/repo.git, the command would be:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
This will create a new directory with the name of the repository, and download the contents of the repository into that directory.
