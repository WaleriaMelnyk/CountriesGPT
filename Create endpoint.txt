Use minimal API
1. Create the endpoint that accepts parameters. Endpoint could accept from 0 to 3 parameters, type string, number, string. Naming is optional.
2. Make a request to the public `REST Countries` API using endpoint https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all
3. Parse retrieved API response data in JSON to variable/object.

To achieve what you've described, you can use a simple server framework like Express for Node.js. I'll show you a minimal example to create an endpoint that accepts parameters and makes a request to the REST Countries API.

First, you need to have Node.js installed. If you haven't already, you can download it from the official site.

Once you have Node.js installed, follow these steps:

Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it:

sh
Copy code
mkdir my-api
cd my-api
Initialize a new Node.js project and install the necessary dependencies:

sh
Copy code
npm init -y
npm install express axios
Create a file named index.js. This file will contain the code for your server:

sh
Copy code
touch index.js
Edit index.js and add the following code:

javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const axios = require('axios');

const app = express();

// The endpoint that accepts parameters (0 to 3, in order: string, number, string)
app.get('/my-endpoint', async (req, res) => {
  // Parameters
  const param1 = req.query.param1 || null;
  const param2 = req.query.param2 || null;
  const param3 = req.query.param3 || null;

  try {
    // Make a request to the REST Countries API
    const response = await axios.get('https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all');

    // Parse retrieved API response data to variable
    const countries = response.data;

    // You can do something with the parameters and countries data here
    // For this example, just send the countries data as response
    res.json(countries);

  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    res.status(500).send('Error retrieving countries data');
  }
});

// Start the server
const port = 3000;
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
Run your server:

sh
Copy code
node index.js
Your server should be running at http://localhost:3000. You can now make requests to your endpoint by visiting http://localhost:3000/my-endpoint in your browser or using a tool like Postman. Optionally, you can also pass query parameters like http://localhost:3000/my-endpoint?param1=hello&param2=123&param3=world.

Remember this is a very basic example meant for educational purposes. If you are planning to use this code in a production environment, there are many additional considerations, such as error handling, security, and optimizations that you need to take into account.

In order to create a minimal API using ASP.NET Core, you'll need to have the .NET SDK installed on your machine. After you have installed the .NET SDK, you can create a minimal web API using the following steps:

Create a new Web API project.

sh
Copy code
dotnet new web -n MyMinimalApi
cd MyMinimalApi
Open the Program.cs file, which is the main file for the project, and replace its content with the following code:

csharp
Copy code
using System;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Builder;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http;
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;

var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

// Add services to the DI container.
builder.Services.AddHttpClient();

var app = builder.Build();

// Middleware for handling endpoints
app.MapGet("/my-endpoint", async (IHttpClientFactory clientFactory, HttpContext httpContext) =>
{
    // Read the query parameters (optional)
    var param1 = httpContext.Request.Query["param1"].ToString();
    var param2 = httpContext.Request.Query["param2"].ToString();
    var param3 = httpContext.Request.Query["param3"].ToString();

    // Make a request to the REST Countries API
    var client = clientFactory.CreateClient();
    var response = await client.GetAsync("https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all");

    if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
    {
        var content = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

        // Response in JSON format
        httpContext.Response.ContentType = "application/json";
        await httpContext.Response.WriteAsync(content);
    }
    else
    {
        httpContext.Response.StatusCode = 500;
        await httpContext.Response.WriteAsync("Error retrieving countries data");
    }
});

app.Run();
Run the project by executing the following command:

sh
Copy code
dotnet run
This will start a web server listening on http://localhost:5000 and https://localhost:5001. You can test your new endpoint by visiting http://localhost:5000/my-endpoint in your web browser or by using a tool like Postman. You can also pass query parameters like http://localhost:5000/my-endpoint?param1=hello&param2=123&param3=world.

Keep in mind that this example is for educational purposes and should not be considered production-ready. In a production environment, you would need to add additional error handling, validation, and security measures.
